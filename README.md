# Content Sharing Web App(ReelLife) Readme

## Description

This web application enables users to create and share posts, as well as engage in discussions through comments. It is based around the idea of needing a social media platform for people in the fishing community to hopefully make it more popular with the younger generations.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to implement a few new features to enhance the user experience and functionality of ReelLife. Some of the upcoming additions include:

- **Post Editing**: I aim to allow users to edit their posts, providing the flexibility to update content or correct any mistakes.

- **Comment Editing**: Users will have the ability to edit their comments, ensuring they can refine their contributions.

- **Google Maps Integration**: I plan to add a Google Maps feature to posts, allowing users to specify the location where they made their catch. This will provide a visual representation of the catch location.

- **Like Functionality**: Introducing a "like" feature will enable users to express their appreciation for posts and comments.

- **Advanced CSS Styling**: I am committed to further refining the visual aspects of the application, focusing on providing a seamless and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

Additionally, I plan to implement the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to enhance the organization and maintainability of the codebase. This design pattern will help create a more modular and structured application.
